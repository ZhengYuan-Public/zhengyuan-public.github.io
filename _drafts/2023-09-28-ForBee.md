## Understand the world

> All models are wrong, but some are **useful**.                                   George Box

### Human Behaviors

> Empathy is important at first, but it won't solve the problem itself unless you actively deconstruct the problem and find a solution.

#### Examples

Why he/she is so $ X_{\{ adj \}} $?

- In the story you told me, were you wrong?

What do their behaviors imply?

- (My observation) You tend to blame yourself. This **is** a personality weakness.
- (My suggestion) You need a more solid **source of self-esteem**, not a mature/fierce appearance
  - Recognition by others $ \longrightarrow $ Recognition by yourself

The world is complex and things happen because of many different reasons. Some are under your control, while others are not. Hope you have the strength to accept what you cannot change, have the courage to change what you can change and have the wisdom to tell the differences.

Have you already tried your best? Do you have regrets?

## 100% Personal Suggestions

### About Love

This world is already such a mess and love is the last standpoint I believe could still be clean. Feel free to utilize everything at your disposal to achieve what you want, except love. Love someone with all your heart, not your brain, and never genitalia.

Treat all love seriously, not as games. 

### About Friends

A friend in need is a friend indeed.

It's impossible to make everyone like you. The only thing that matters is, *Do you like yourself*?

### About Life

Know yourself. It's something that deserves to be practiced throughout your life. You are not defined by your body shape, your wealth, or your friends. 

Know what you want to be and stick to it.

Refuse others without feeling guilty.

Not everything can be repaired if it's broken, such as trust and integrity. Don't lose yourself.
