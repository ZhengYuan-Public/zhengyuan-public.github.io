## EEG - Origin and Measurement

The EEG consists of the **summed** electrical activities of **populations of neurons**, with a **modest contribution** from glial cells. The neurons are **excitable** cells with **characteristic intrinsic electrical properties**, and their activity produces **electrical and magnetic fields**.

### Two Types of Neuronal Activations

1. Action Potential
2. Synaptic Activation
   - EPSP
     - Positive ions inwards (e.g., $$ Na^+ $$)
   - IPSP
     - Negative ions inwards (e.g., $$ Cl^- $$)
     - Positive ions outwards (e.g., $$ K^+ $$)

### Sink-Source Configuration

> There is **no accumulation of charge** anywhere in the medium, the transmembrane currents that flow in or out of the neuron at the active synaptic sites are **compensated** by currents that flow in the opposite direction elsewhere along the neuronal membrane.

- Active **sink** is generated in the extracellular medium at the level of an **excitatory** synapse. **Distributed passive sources** along the soma-dendritic membrane.

- Active **source** is generated in the extracellular medium at the level of an **inhibitory** synapse. **Distributed passive sinks** along the soma-dendritic membrane.

- The flows of these compensating extracellularly currents depend on the **electrical properties** of the local tissue. Glial cells occupy an important part of the space between neurons and are coupled to one another by **<u>gap junctions</u>** (the conductivity is sensitive to changes in $$ pH $$, extracellular $$ K^+ $$ and $$ Ca^{2+} $$, and physiological/pathological conditions).
