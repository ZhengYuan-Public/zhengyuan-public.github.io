## A Model for Methodology

> A **useful** writing model can be transferred, but don't expect a perfect model.
> > **All models are wrong, but some are useful.**  The famous quote about statistical models by George E.P. Box also applies to writing models.

### Four Basic Components

|                            Goals                             |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|                          **Part I**                          |
| Provide a general introduction and overview of the materials/methods |
|               Restate the purpose of the work                |
|         Give the source of materials/equipment used          |
|           Supply essential background information            |
|                         **Part II**                          |
| Provide specific and precise details about materials and methods |
|                     Justify choices made                     |
|           Indicate that appropriate care was taken           |
|                         **Part III**                         |
|          Relate materials/methods to other studies           |
|                         **Part IV**                          |
|               Indicate where problems occurred               |

### Train of Thoughts

A good writing model for the Methodology/Experiments section should answer the following questions:

- How do writers normally **start** the Methodology/Experiments?
- What **type of information** should it contain, and in what **order**?
- How do writers normally **end** the Methodology/Experiments?

## Grammar and Skills

### Passive and Tense Pairs

- Check with the Guide for Authors in your target journal to decide whether this part should be written in the active or passive form. 

- Using the active is not usually appropriate for a Ph.D. thesis because it's not normally written up in the first person singular.

In most cases, the procedure used is described in the passive, either in the **Present Simple Passive** or in the **Past Simple Passive**. In formal academic writing, always use the **agentless passive**.

A common need is to distinguish between standard procedures and methods used in the present research. It's conventional to use the agentless passive for both, and the only way to separate them is the correct tense. Therefore, **it's clearer to use the Present Simple passive for standard procedures and the Past Simple passive for methods used in the present research** whenever possible (remember to check your target journal first).

> Make sure the readers can identify the contributions of the present work!
{: .prompt-tip }

There are several ways to make sure that the previously mentioned differences are clear and easy to identify:

- Move to the active.
- Mark it with words, such as **In (this/our/their) (procedure/study/experiment/model)**.
- Use a dummy subject, such as **This study/experiment/model**.
- When a reference is needed for standard procedures, use phrases such as **as in**.

### Use of "A/An" and "The"

#### General Rules

> 1. Singular countable nouns need a determiner.
> 2. Use **The** if/when you and your readers both know which thing/person you mean.
> 3. Use **The** if there is only one possible referent.
> 4. Use **A/An** if it doesn't matter/you or your readers don't know which thing/person you are referring to.

##### Rule No. 1

> <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-short-wide"></i> No. 1 - A determiner is a word like **the**, **a/an**, **my**, **this one**, **some**, etc.

Deciding which nouns are countable nouns and which aren’t isn’t as easy as it looks. Many nouns which are often considered uncountable can actually be used "countably". 

Here is a list of uncountable nouns, but those marked as italics can also be used in the plural, i.e., countably.

| :-----------: | :-------------: | :-----------: | :--------------: | :--------------: |

|   **rain**    |     *sand*      |  *strength*   |    *silence*     |     *safety*     |
|    *salt*     |    *science*    |    *time*     |    **stuff**     |    **sleep**     |
| **swimming**  |     *space*     |   *trouble*   |     *trade*      |   **sunlight**   |
| **transport** |  *technology*   |    *waste*    |     *truth*      |   **traffic**    |
|   *vision*    |   *treatment*   |    *water*    |    *velocity*    |   **violence**   |
| **wildlife**  |     *wind*      |   **work**    |    **wealth**    |   **welfare**    |

 When using a word of this kind, stop and think if it's being used to mean **something in general** (uncountable) or **something particular** (countable).
