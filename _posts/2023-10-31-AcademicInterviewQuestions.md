## Train of Thoughts

PhD programs are typically long-term and you are stuck with something in particular. They are also challenging but not well-paid. Do whatever you can to show that you are committed to the particular PhD position because their is always a risk that the student/candidate will drop out at some point. This is particularly important if the position is funded.

Ask yourself **what the interview committee seeks to learn about you** through their questions. **Identify the different categories of information** relevant to the type of interview you are attending, and practice answers to each. Please note that even seemingly general interview questions like "*Tell us about yourself*" should be answered with **relevance to the position** in mind.

Prepare two versions of an answer for each category: a 30-second version and a two-minute version. The average speaking rate is 130 words per minute (WPM), so your answers should have roughly **65 and 260 words respectively**.

> The interviewer typically seeks to know six things about the candidate:
> 1. Is the candidate **competent**?
> 2. Can the candidate **work with others**?
> 3. Does the candidate demonstrate a range of **interpersonal skills**?
> 4. Does the candidate seem **friendly**?
> 5. Could I consider the candidate a **colleague**?
> 6. Will the candidate add something **beneficial to our group**?

1. Why did you change your major?



1. Tell us about yourself.
    > Tips:
    >
    > - Start by introducing yourself and your academic background. Mention your most relevant research experience and publications.
    >   - It is a good idea to mention your English name in a PhD interview if your name is in another language and is difficult to pronounce. This will help the interviewer to remember your name and to address you correctly.
    >
    > - Briefly discuss your research interests and why you are interested in the PhD program.
    > - Highlight your skills and qualities that make you a good fit for the program, such as your critical thinking skills, your ability to work independently, and your passion for research.
    > - Be sure to connect your answers back to the PhD program and the faculty. For example, you could mention a specific research project that you are interested in working on with a particular faculty member.

    > **[Background]** Good morning/afternoon everyone, my name is Zheng Yuan. It is a little difficult to pronounce in English, so please call me Michael. I hold a Master of Science degree in Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience from the University of Sheffield and I'm currently working as a research assistant in the Health Informatics Lab of Jilin University.
    >
    > **[Research Interest and Hard Skills]** I've been fascinated by the human brain for a very long time and I'm excited to do research in Computational Neuroscience. With the recent advancement of Machine Learning, availability of data, and computational power, I'm interested in developing machine learning models as tools for

    > My research experiences include mathematical modeling, deep learning, and bioinformatics. I'm a proficient programmer in MATLAB and Python, and I have experience in IT infrastructure administration, gained by DIY my home lab and maintenance of two lab servers. As a research assistant, I have also taught mathematics and programming to newcomers to the lab and my friends from other disciplines.
    >
    > **[Personality and Soft Skills]** I'm a curious person and I really enjoy doing research. I love solving problems and learning new skills during that process. For example, in my last bioinformatics research, I learned a lot about the state-of-the-art understanding of cancers, including their initiation, progression, and metastasis. I also learned how to efficiently pre-process and analyze bioinformatics datasets. I can still remember the joy I got when my program was running at least 30 times faster by using concurrency and other optimization methods.
    >
    > **[Being a Good collaborator]** Working in a team consisting of experts from different disciplines was also interesting and exciting. On the one hand, I had the chance to learn and observe the discrepancies in the way they think; on the other hand, the demand to communicate technical ideas using daily language was challenging, but this process has also deepened my understanding of those technical ideas. 
    >
    > **[Conclusion]** I am confident that my background and skills make me a strong fit for this PhD position.

2. Why did you change your major?
  > Tips:
  > - Be honest and upfront about your reasons for changing your major. Don't try to sugarcoat things or make excuses.
  > - Focus on the positive aspects of your decision. Explain how changing your major helped you to discover your true passion or to develop the skills and knowledge that you need to achieve your career goals.
  > - Be specific and provide examples. Don't just say that you changed your major because you were "more interested" in another field. Explain what specifically drew you to your new major and what you hope to achieve by studying it.
  > - Show that you are still passionate about your current field of study. Even if you changed your major because you realized that it was not a good fit for you, you should still be able to articulate why you are interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in your current field.

  > I was born and raised in a small town and I had few chances to explore my interest before going to university. I originally started out majoring in Civil Engineering because I thought it was a practical choice. I was deeply fascinated by the human brain after reading the book Cybernetics by Norbert Wiener while exploring my interest
  >
  > Changing my major was one of the best and hardest decisions I have ever made. I am now much more engaged in my studies and I am excited about the future. I am particularly interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in psychology so that I can study the cognitive processes involved in decision-making.

#### Why do you want to do a PhD?

> - Passion
> - Commitment
> - Academic Career

There are several reasons why I want to pursuit a Doctor's degree. 

First of all, I was deeply fascinated by the human brain after watching a TED talk from Dr. Ramachandran on several peculiar neurological syndromes. I was particularly intrigued by the connection between abstract thinkings and the phenomenon of synestheisa. This sparked my interest in learning more about how the human brain and I gradually developed a ken interest in computational neuroscience.

Secondly, I'm really interested in the intersection between artificial intelligence and computational neuroscience. With the recent development in machine learning, data availability, and computational power, I believe machine learning algorithms are powerful tools in facilitating researches and applications of computational neuroscience, and actually vice versa. For example, machine learning is being used to develop new methods for analyzing neuroimaging data. I believe that this intersection between AI and computational neuroscience has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the human brain and lead to novel applications.

So, after getting my master's degree in computational neuronscience, I joined the Health Informatics Lab as a teaching assistant for almost a year and half now to learn more about machine learning. I've been working on research projects in the lab regarding identification of novel biomarkers in thyroid cancer and objects detection on aerial images. This experience has gave me the skills and knowledge to be a strong fit of this PhD position.

Last but not least, doing a PhD is an imporant part of my career path. I want to become a leading researcher in the field of computational neuroscience and develop new technologies to help people with neurological disorders.
