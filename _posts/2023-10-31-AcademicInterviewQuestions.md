## Train of Thoughts

PhD programs are typically long-term and you are stuck with something in particular. They are also challenging but not well-paid. Do whatever you can to show that you are committed to the particular PhD position because their is always a risk that the student/candidate will drop out at some point. This is particularly important if the position is funded.

Ask yourself **what the interview committee seeks to learn about you** through their questions. **Identify the different categories of information** relevant to the type of interview you are attending, and practice answers to each. Please note that even seemingly general interview questions like "*Tell us about yourself*" should be answered with **relevance to the position** in mind.

Prepare two versions of an answer for each category: a 30-second version and a two-minute version. The average speaking rate is 130 words per minute (WPM), so your answers should have roughly **65 and 260 words respectively**.

> The interviewer typically seeks to know six things about the candidate:
> 1. Is the candidate **competent**?
> 2. Can the candidate **work with others**?
> 3. Does the candidate demonstrate a range of **interpersonal skills**?
> 4. Does the candidate seem **friendly**?
> 5. Could I consider the candidate a **colleague**?
> 6. Will the candidate add something **beneficial to our group**?
