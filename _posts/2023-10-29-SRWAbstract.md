## Structure

### A Brief History of Abstract

The structure and content of the Abstract have changed in recent decades. Before online publication databases, the Abstract was printed at the top of a research article and its function was mainly to **encourage the reader to continue reading the article** and to **facilitate that reading by providing a brief preview**. The reader and the writer <span style="color:red">didn't</span> consider the Abstract of a research article as an <span style="color:red">independent unit</span> because it was not normally read without reference to the article itself.

Abstract databases allow scientists to search and scan the scientific literature and then decide which research articles they want to read in detail. Abstracts **compete for attention** in online databases and need to **persuade readers to obtain a copy**, not just encourage them to keep reading a paper they have already accessed.

Many people will read the title more than the Abstract, and many more will read the Abstract than the whole paper. Therefore, Abstracts are representations of the research article that need to have independent validity. They should:

- Make sense as a standalone, self-contained description of the research article.
- Present the key points and results of the research even if readers never see the whole article.

> The best time to write an Introduction is **after** the whole article has been written.

## Two Models for Abstract

> A **useful** writing model can be transferred, but don't expect a perfect model.
> > **All models are wrong, but some are useful.**  The famous quote about statistical models by George E.P. Box also applies to writing models.

| :----------------------: |
|        **Part I**        |
|        Background        |
|           Aim            |
|         Problem          |
|   What the Paper Does    |
|       **Part II**        |
|  Methodology/Materials   |
|       **Part III**       |
|         Results          |
| Achievement/Contribution |
|       Implications       |
|       **Part IV**        |
|       Limitations        |
|       Future Work        |

### Train of Thoughts

#### Why Written in the Last

- The style and length of the Abstract depend on where you plan to submit it and that decision may be taken late in, or even after, the writing process.
- The content of the Abstract is derived from the rest of the article.
- The Abstract does not contain material that is not already in the paper.

#### Two Models

Most Abstracts are **results-focused**, but there are two models:

1. The first model is similar to a summary and structured
   - Deal with all main subsections and can have subtitles.
2. The second model is more common
   - focuses primarily on one or two aspects of the study (usually Methodology and Results)
3. Choosing which model to use is based on the type of research you have done and the Guide for Authors of the journal. It's typically determined by the journal rather than the author. Generally speaking, the more narrow and specified your research topic, the less likely you are to use the summary format. Because in a narrow research field, most readers already know the background.

A good writing model for the Abstract section should answer the following questions:

- How do writers normally **start** the Abstract?
- What **type of information** should it contain, and in what **order**?
- How do writers normally **end** the Abstract?

## Grammar and Writing Skills

### Verb Tense

Verb tense is especially important in the Abstract because the strict word limit means that you may need to omit phrases that tell the reader whose work you are referring to, or what you think about your results.

#### Results

|                       (Present Simple)                       |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: |

|               This finding correlated with...                |

It's possible to use two different tenses in one sentence. Even if the first part of the sentence is in the Past Simple tense, you can decide to put the findings/results or the implications of the findings/results in the Present Simple tense if you believe it is strong enough to be considered a fact or truth.

### Length

The Abstract usually has a strict word limit. Most Abstracts are between 80–150 words and longer Abstracts are between 150–250 words, but they should be in a single paragraph. For your first draft, don’t worry too much about the word limit. Once you have decided which of the two Abstract models you will use, start by including whatever you think is important, and then gradually remove words, phrases, and even sentences that are not essential.

### Language

Think of the **search phrases** and **keywords** that people looking for your work might use. Make sure that those **exact words or phrases** appear in your Abstract so that they will turn up at the top of a search result listing.

To attract a wider audience, the Abstracts are sometimes written in a slightly less technical way. You can use the acronym, abbreviation, or technical term in the Abstract, but you should first say what it means or stands for.
