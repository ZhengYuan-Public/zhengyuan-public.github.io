## Overall Structure of a Paper or Thesis



## Introduction

### Structure

Much of your science writing has focused on describing what you did and what you found will help you write the central report section, but **writing an Introduction is a new task**.

> The best time to write an Introduction is **after** you have written, or at least drafted the report section.
{: .prompt-tip }

Your writing model for the Introduction section should answer the following questions:

- How do writers normally **start** the Introduction?
- What **type of information** should it contain, and in what **order**?
- How do writers normally **end** the Introduction?

### Grammar and Skills

#### Tenses

##### Present Simple

- The **Present Simple** tense is used in science writing to state **accepted facts and truth**, but it's your decision to decide what qualifies.
- Using the **Present Simple** tense means that you believe your findings and deductions are strong enough to be considered facts or truth.

> *One way to toughen polymers **is** to incorporate a layer of rubber particles5 and there has been extensive research regarding the rubber modification of PLA.*

##### Past Simple / Present Perfect

- The **Present Perfect** tense is considered more relevant to the situation now than the **Past Simple** tense.

> *For example, Penney et al. **showed** that PLA composites could be prepared using blending techniques, and more recently, Hillier **established** the toughness of such composites. However, although the effect of the rubber particles on the mechanical properties of copolymer systems **was demonstrated** over two years ago, little attention **has been paid** to the selection of an appropriate rubber component.*

##### Changing Tense

**Tense changes** are always meaningful, and they always **signal a change in the function of the information**.

> Don't change tense randomly, and make sure you change tense when you should.
