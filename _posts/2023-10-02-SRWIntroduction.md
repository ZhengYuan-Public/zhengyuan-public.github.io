*Science Research Writing for Non-Native Speakers of English* by {% cite glasman2009science --file books%} takes all the credit for images and examples.

## Structure

### Information Flow

<img src="/assets/img/images_writing/srw_introduction.png" alt="srw_introduction" style="zoom:30%;" />

It's probably true that your science writing has focused on **describing what you did and what you found**, which will help you write the central report section. However, **writing an Introduction is a new task**. In the introduction, you start by being fairly general and gradually narrowing your focus, whereas the opposite is true in the Discussion/Conclusion.

> The best time to write an Introduction is **after** the report section has been written, or at least drafted.

## A Model for Introduction

> A **useful** model can be transferred to other Introductions, but don't expect a perfect model. 
> > **All models are wrong, but some are useful.**  The famous quote about statistical models by George E.P. Box also applies to writing models.

### Four Basic Components

| Goals                                                        |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Part I**                                                   |
| Establish the importance of your field                       |
| Provide background facts/information (possibly from research) |
| Define the terminology in the title/keywords                 |
| Present the problem area/current research focus              |
| **Part II**                                                  |
| Previous and/or current research, and contributions          |
| **Part III**                                                 |
| Locate a gap in the research                                 |
| Describe the problem you will address                        |
| Present a prediction to be tested                            |
| **Part IV**                                                  |
| Describe the present paper                                   |

### Train of Thoughts

A good writing model for the Introduction section should answer the following questions:

- How do writers normally **start** the Introduction?
- What **type of information** should it contain, and in what **order**?
- How do writers normally **end** the Introduction?

When writing an Introduction, ask yourself the following questions:

- **Which** of the research papers I have read should be mentioned somewhere in the Introduction?
- Which ones should be part of the **background** and which ones should go in the **literature review** which comes later?
- In what **order** should I mention them? There are several options:
  - **chronological**
  - **different approaches/theories/models**
  - **general/specific**: Start with general and gradually move to research that is closer to your own

#### Miscellaneous

How to find out what the author is doing in a sentence, rather than what s/he is saying? Here are some methods:

- What's the difference for you as a reader if a sentence were deleted?
- Look at the grammar and vocabulary clues. 
  - What's the tense and what is that tense normally used for?
  - Why did the author change the tense?

Include references wherever it is useful, even in a sentence whose function is primarily to provide a transition. Here are some of the reasons:

- Plagiarism is unprofessional.
- Give readers a chance to find and read the study mentioned.
- Indicate the writer is familiar with the field.

## Grammar and Skills

### Tenses

#### Present Simple

-  In science writing, the **Present Simple** tense is used to state **accepted facts and truth**, but it's the writer's decision to decide what qualifies as facts and truth.
- Using the **Present Simple** tense means that you believe your findings and deductions are strong enough to be considered facts or truth.

> *One way to toughen polymers **is** to incorporate a layer of rubber particles5 and there has been extensive research regarding the rubber modification of PLA.*

#### Past Simple / Present Perfect

- The **Present Perfect** tense is considered **more relevant to the situation now** than the Past Simple tense.

> *For example, Penney et al. **showed** that PLA composites could be prepared using blending techniques, and more recently, Hillier **established** the toughness of such composites. However, although the effect of the rubber particles on the mechanical properties of copolymer systems **was demonstrated** over two years ago, little attention **has been paid** to the selection of an appropriate rubber component.*

#### Changing Tense

**Tense changes** are always meaningful, and they always **signal a change in the function of the information**.

> Don't change tense randomly, and make sure you change tense when you should.
{: .prompt-tip }

### Signaling Language

One of the most common errors in writing is **failing to connect one sentence or idea to the next**. The space between a full stop and the next capital letter is dangerous for the writer and readers. One of the tasks of a writer is to make sure the gap is closed so that the reader is carried carefully from one piece of information to the next.

Here are several ways to fill the gap:

1. **Overlap**, meaning to repeat something from the previous sentence

    > *The pattern of inflammation during an <u>asthma attack</u> is different from that seen in stable asthma. In **<u>stable asthma</u>**, the total number of inflammatory cells does not increase.*
    >
    > 
    >
    > *One way to toughen polymers is to incorporate a layer of <u>rubber</u> particles. As a result, there has been extensive research regarding the **<u>rubber</u>** modification of PLA.*

2. **Pronoun** or **Pro-form**

    > *Many researchers have suggested ways of reducing costs without affecting the quality of the image. **<u>These methods</u>** rely on data structures built during a preprocessing step.*
    >
    > 
    >
    > *On the basis of these criteria, it then describes the preparation of a set of polymer blends using PLA and a hydrocarbon rubber (PI). **<u>This combination</u>** of two mechanistically distinct polymerizations formed a novel copolymer in which the incorporation of PI significantly increased flexibility.*

3. Join the first sentence to the next one with a **semicolon** or a **relative clause** 

    > *The procedure for testing whether components are operationally safe usually takes many hours**<u> ; </u>** this means that tests are rarely repeated.*
    >
    > *It has received much attention over the past few decades due to its biodegradable properties, **<u>which</u>** offer important economic benefits.*

4. Signaling sentence connector

    | Cause   |                               |
    | ------- | ----------------------------- |
    | as      | due to (the fact that)        |
    | because | on account of (the fact that) |
    | since   | in view of (the fact that)    |

    - Be careful with **since**, which is also often used to mean "from that time". Use another word if there is any possibility of confusion.

    - All of them can be used at the start of a sentence.

    | Result       |                        |
    | ------------ | ---------------------- |
    | therefore    | as a result (of which) |
    | consequently | which is why           |
    | hence        | so                     |

	- Don't start sentences with the word **so**, because it's too informal.
	- You can sometimes use **then**, but it won't always work. That's why it was excluded from the list.
	
	| Contrast / Difference |                   |
	| --------------------- | ----------------- |
	| however               | on the other hand |
	| whereas               | while             |
	| but                   | by contrast       |
	
	- Be careful with **while**, which is also often used to mean "at that/the same time". Use another word if there is any possibility of confusion.
	- **on the contrary** and **conversely** don't fit into this category because they don't only communicate differences; they communicate the fact that "exactly the opposite is true".
	
	| Unexpectedness                        |                                    |
	| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
	| (Used at the beginning of a sentence) | (Used at the middle of a sentence) |
	| Although / Even though / Though       | nevertheless                       |
	| Despite / In spite of                 | however                            |
	| Regardless of                         | yet                                |
	| Notwithstanding                       | nonetheless                        |
	|                                       | even so                            |
	
	- **still** and **anyway** are more informal, therefore excluded from the list.
	
	| Addition    |                            |
	| ----------- | -------------------------- |
	| in addition | also                       |
	| moreover    | secondly (etc.)            |
	| furthermore | in the second place (etc.) |
	| apart from  | what is more               |
	
	- **besides** has a similar meaning, but it's more powerful and should be used in more persuasive contexts.

### Passive or Active

- The word **we** can be used to refer to your <u>research group or team</u>, but not ~~people or humanity in general~~; It's better to use a construction with *it*, such as "*It's known/thought that ...*"; It's more common to use the passive instead of we, especially in the central report section.
- Cannot write your thesis using **I**, so probably write in the passive. Use words like *here* and *in this study* to let readers know when you are referring to your own work.
- Use a "dummy" subject to take the place of **I** or **we**.

    > ***This article** describes an algorithm for clustering sequences into index classes.*
    >
    > 
    >
    > ***The present paper** presents a set of criteria for selecting such a component.*
    
- The problem with using the passive in formal writing is that the agent (the person who performed the action of the verb) is often not mentioned in the sentence, so the reader may not know who did it or who identified it. This can cause confusion and for that reason, it is sometimes clearer to use a dummy subject rather than the ‘agentless’ passive.

### Paragraphing

> Paragraphs are an important **visual aid** for effective reading (skimming) and writing.
{: .prompt-tip }

#### Paragraphing for Effective Reading (Skimming)

1. Read the **title**, and try to predict the type of information you expect to see.
2. Glance at **the name of the author**. What you know about the writer will help you predict and
   evaluate the content.
3. Check the **date**, and use it to help you assess the content.
4. Read the **abstract** to find out what the researchers did and/or what they found.
5. at **the first paragraph**, without trying to understand all the words.
6. Glance at **the first sentence of each paragraph**, without trying to understand all the words.
7. Glance at **each figure/table** and read its **title**, to try and find out what type of visual data is included.
8. Read **the last paragraph**, especially if it has a subtitle like "Summary" or "Conclusion".

#### Paragraphing for Writing

>  <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-short-wide"></i> No.6 - Glance at the first sentence of each paragraph

A paragraph in academic writing often **starts with a topic sentence**, which gives the **main idea** of the paragraph, and tells the reader **what the paragraph is about**. The rest are related to this idea by discussing, describing, defining, arguing, giving examples, rephrasing, etc. When the ‘topic’ or idea moves too far away from the first sentence, the writer usually **begins a new paragraph**.

It's easy to form **poor paragraphing habits**:

- often write one-sentence paragraphs
- often write very long paragraphs
- not sure when to start a new paragraph

When you are planning your paper, write down each idea/concept that you want to talk about, checking that they are in a logical order and then listing what you want to say about each, using bullet points.

- **Don’t rely on one-size-fits-all verbs such as *discuss***; some chapters/sections do not "discuss" anything, and even if they do, their **main purpose** may be to **compare** things, **analyze** things or **describe** things rather than to discuss them.
