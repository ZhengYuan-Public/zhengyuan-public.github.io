## Key Components

### V-Trace

### TD($$ \lambda $$)

# Architecture

$$ \pi_{\theta}(a_t \vert s_t, z) = \mathbb{P}[a_t \vert s_t, z] $$

## General-purpose Neural Network Components

Observation of Units
- Self-attention mechanism
- Spactial and non-spatial information --> Scatter connections
- Partial observability --> Deep LSTM
- Structured, combinatorial action space ---> Auto-regressive policy and Recurrent Pointer Network
