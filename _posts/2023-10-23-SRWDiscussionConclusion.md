## A Model for Discussion / Conclusion

> A **useful** writing model can be transferred, but don't expect a perfect model.
> > **All models are wrong, but some are useful.**  The famous quote about statistical models by George E.P. Box also applies to writing models.

### Four Basic Components

|                Model Components                |
| :--------------------------------------------: |
|                   **Part I**                   |
|          Revisiting previous sections          |
| Summarizing/Revisiting General or Key Results  |
|                  **Part II**                   |
| Mapping the Present Work into the Research Map |
|                  **Part III**                  |
|            Achievement/Contribution            |
|           Refining the Implications            |
|                  **Part IV**                   |
|                  Limitations                   |
|            Current and Future Work             |
|                  Applications                  |

### Train of Thoughts

In this section, the message that you'd like to send to your readers is: 

>  Something is a **possible** reason, or an **obvious** interpretation, or a **probable** implication.
{: .prompt-tip}

A good writing model for the Discussion/Conclusion section should answer the following questions:

- How do writers normally **start** the Discussion/Conclusion?
- What **type of information** should it contain, and in what **order**?
- How do writers normally **end** the Discussion/Conclusion?

In the Discussion/Conclusion section (in contrast to the Introduction section), you

- Begin by revisiting some aspects of your work to create a reverse interface.
- Move away from your relatively narrow research focus to a wider, more general focus.
- End by helping your readers move out of the article.
- Locate your study in relation to that research map.
- Articulate to what extent you have responded to that gap or solved the problem.

You will normally outline the limitations of your own work, but this is **NOT expressed as a problem with your work**, rather it provides suggestions for future work. This invitation to the research community improves the status of your work by communicating that there is much research to be done in
this area.

- Use *will* to communicate your own intentions or work in progress.
- Use *should* to invite research from others.

## Grammar and Writing Skills

### Modal Verbs

Modal verbs are often used to modify the "truth value" of a sentence. They are difficult to use for mainly two reasons. First of all, some modal verbs have more than one meaning. Therefore, make sure you know exactly what's your implication when you are using a modal verb. Second, most modal verbs do not follow standard grammar rules. Some disappear and others change their meaning in the negative, or in a different tense.

> Some use of modal verbs, such as suing *may* and *can* to **request permission**, are not included because they are not useful in science research writing.

### Ability/Capability

|            Tense             |      Form      |                           Example                            |
| :--------------------------: | :------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|        Present Simple        |      can       |   This software can distinguish between different viruses.   |
| Present Simple<br />Negative |     cannot     | Until 18 months a child cannot use symbols to represent objects. |
|         Past Simple          |     could      | It was found that the gun could shoot accurately even at 300 meters. |
|                              |   could have   | If we had extended the time period we could have produced more crystals. |
|  Past Simple<br />Negative   |   could not    | In 1990, 80% of households could not receive digital television. |
|                              | could not have | The subjects reported that they could not have fallen asleep without medication. |

- For Future Simple tense, you need to switch to **be capable of** or **be able to**.
- **Could** means "was generally capable of doing/was able to do something in the past", whereas **was able to** is used in relation to specific past events or past occasions. Generally speaking, **be able to** is a safer choice when you are not sure which to use.

### Possibility/Options

|             Tense             |                             Form                             |                           Example                            |
| :---------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|        Present Simple         |              may<br />might<br />could<br />can              | A rubber seal **may/might/could/can** be useful at <br />this location. |
| Present Simple<br /> Negative |  may not<br />might not<br />~~could not~~<br />~~cannot~~   | A rubber seal **may not/might not** be useful at <br />this location. |
|          Past Simple          |  may have<br />might have<br />could have<br />~~can have~~  | The fall in pressure **may have been/might have been/could <br />have been** caused by leakage. |
|  Past Simple<br /> Negative   | may not have<br />might not have<br />~~could not have~~<br />~~cannot have~~ | The fall in pressure **may not have been/might not <br />have been** caused by leakage. |

- **well** can be added to communicate a stronger belief in the possibility.
  
  > *This **may well** be due to leakage.*
  
- **might** is slightly weaker than **may**

- **can not** and **cannot** don't mean the same thing at all!

  - **can not** means *possibly not* in the same way as **may not** or **might not**
  - **cannot** means **impossible**


### Probability/Belief/Expectation

|             Tense             |                  Form                  |                           Example                            |
| :---------------------------: | :------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|        Present Simple         |          should<br />ought to          | The material **should** remain stable if it is kept below 30°C. |
| Present Simple<br /> Negative |      should not<br />ought not to      | It is clear that contamination **cannot/could not** be due to<br />the presence of sea water in the pipe. |
|          Past Simple          |     should have<br />ought to have     | Our results indicate that contamination **must have been** due <br />to the presence of sea water in the pipe. |
|   Past Simple<br />Negative   | should not have<br />ought not to have | It was clear that contamination **could not be/cannot <br />have been/could not have been** due to the <br />presence of sea water in the pipe. |

\*Although **ought to** means the same as **should**, it's less common in science research writing.

### Virtual Certainty

|             Tense             |                      Form                      |                           Example                            |
| :---------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|        Present Simple         |               must<br />have to                | Our results indicate that contamination **must** be <br />due to the presence of sea water in the pipe. |
| Present Simple<br /> Negative |                     cannot                     | It is clear that contamination **cannot/could not** be <br />due to the presence of sea water in the pipe. |
|          Past Simple          |                   must have                    | Our results indicate that contamination **must have been** <br />due to the presence of sea water in the pipe. |
|   Past Simple<br />Negative   | cannot have<br />could not<br />could not have | It was clear that contamination **could not be/cannot <br />have been/could not have been** due to the <br />presence of sea water in the pipe. |

- "virtual certainty" modals communicate the fact that no other explanation is possible.
- **have to** is less common in science writing, so examples have not been given.
- **must not** means "not allowed/permitted", it doesn’t mean "not possible".

### Advice/Opinion

|            Tense             |                  Form                  |                           Example                            |
| :--------------------------: | :------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|        Present Simple        |          should<br />ought to          | The apparatus **should** be disconnected from the mains <br />during repairs. |
| Present Simple<br />Negative |      should not<br />ought not to      |     This material **should not** be exposed to sunlight.     |
|         Past Simple          |     should have<br />ought to have     | Our results indicate that contamination **must have been** <br />due to the presence of sea water in the pipe. |
|  Past Simple<br />Negative   | should not have<br />ought not to have | It was clear that contamination **could not be/cannot <br />have been/could not have been** due to the presence<br />of sea water in the pipe. |

### Necessity/Obligation

|            Tense             |                          Form                           |                           Example                            |
| :--------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|        Present Simple        |             must<br />need to<br />have to              | The apparatus **must/needs to/has to** be disconnected from<br />the mains during repairs. |
| Present Simple<br />Negative |    need not<br />do not need to<br />do not have to     | The apparatus **need not/does not need to/does not have <br />to be** disconnected from the mains during repairs. |
|         Past Simple          |                  needed to<br />had to                  |     We **needed to/had to** heat the valves before use.      |
|  Past Simple<br />Negative   | did not need to<br />did not have to<br />need not have | We **did not need to/did not have to** heat the valves before use.<br /> We **need not have** heated the valves before use. |

### Achievement/Contribution

\*Science writing does not generally permit the use of the exclamation mark (!), but the vocabulary used to state your achievement or contribution can still communicate that the achievement is exciting.
